These are the release notes for STMicroelectronics SensorHAL version 3.
Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about, explain how
to install the dynamic library, and what to do if something goes wrong.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

   Compiling, configuring and running the 3.x SensorHAL requires up-to-date
   versions of various software packages.

   Installing required packages: (used during `menuconfig`)
   $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev

   HAL require two headers file from linux kernel. File can be found under
   Documentation/iio-example-3.1x.y/. Copy files to linux/iio/


INSTALLING SOURCE CODE
   Copy HAL source code into hardware/STMicroelectronics/SensorHAL_IIO folder.
   During build process Android will include automatically the Android.mk.
   In your device.mk (device/{vendor}/{board}/device.mk) adds package build
   information:

   PRODUCT_PACKAGES += sensors.{TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM}

   Note: device.mk can not read $(TARGET_BOARD_PLATFORM) variable, read and
   replace the value from your BoardConfig.mk


CONFIGURING THE SENSOR HAL

--> From SensorHAL_IIO root folder (not for Android pre-release):

   "mm sensors-defconfig"	Generated default hal_config file.

   "mm sensors-menuconfig"	Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.

   "mm sensors-cleanconf"	Delete hal_config, hal_config.old and configuration.h files.

--> From Android source code $TOP folder (Android L/M/N not for Android O preview):

   "make -f Makefile_config sensors-defconfig"	Generated default hal_config file.

   "make -f Makefile_config sensors-menuconfig"	Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.

   "make -f Makefile_configsensors-cleanconf"	Delete hal_config, hal_config.old and configuration.h files.


COMPILING THE SENSOR HAL CODE

--> From From SensorHAL_IIO root folder:

   "mm"			Build the code.

   "mm -B"		Force to rebuild all the code.

   "mm DEBUG=y"		Build SensorHAL in debug mode (no code optimization, generate map file).

--> From Android source code $TOP folder:
   Just build Android source code as described on source.android.com. The SensorHAL will
   be automatically build and installed into system.img

BUILD Linux SensorHAL

   Use Makefile to build SensorHAL.so, CROSS_COMPILE and ARCH environment variables must
   be set to build tools for cross compile to target board.

SENSORS SUPPORTED:
   - ST Test sensors		(Accel + Magn + Gyro);
   - ASM330LHH			(Accel + Gyro)

CHANGELOG:
   v3.0.0: First HAL revision
   v3.1.0: Added selftest program, bugfix
   v3.1.1: Added injection mode, changed way to decimate sensor data
   v3.1.2: Bugfix on flush propagation
   v3.1.3: Fixed compiling issue on Android L and K (wrist-tilt)
   v3.1.4: Added support for ASM330LHH
   v3.1.5: Added support for Android N. Added support for different kernel versions
   v3.1.6: Add support to Android O
