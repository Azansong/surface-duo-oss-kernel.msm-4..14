Flexcan CAN controller on Freescale's ARM and PowerPC system-on-a-chip (SOC).

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "fsl,<processor>-flexcan"

  An implementation should also claim any of the following compatibles
  that it is fully backwards compatible with:

  - fsl,p1010-flexcan
  - fsl,s32v234-flexcan
  - fsl,s32gen1-flexcan

- reg : Offset and length of the register set for this device
- interrupts : Interrupt tuple(s) for this device. If interrupt-names are
               missing, these should specify, in order:
               - for S32V234:
                 1. ERRINT | BOFFINT | BOFFDONEINT | TWRNINT | RWRNINT;
                 2. MB0-63 interrupts;
               - for S32GEN1:
                 1. BOFFINT | BOFFDONEINT | TWRNINT | RWRNINT;
                 2. ERRINT;
                 3. MB0-7 interrupts;
                 4. MB8-127 interrupts;
               - for all the other SoCs:
                 1. all interrupts combined.

Optional properties:

- clock-frequency : The oscillator frequency driving the flexcan device

- xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver

- big-endian: This means the registers of FlexCAN controller are big endian.
              This is optional property.i.e. if this property is not present in
              device tree node then controller is assumed to be little endian.
              if this property is present then controller is assumed to be big
              endian.

- interrupt-names: Allows the interrupt specifiers in "interrupts" to be stated
                   in any order, one for each name in here. Can contain:
                   "state" - BOFFINT | BOFFDONEINT | TWRNINT | RWRNINT;
                   "berr" - ERRINT;
                   "mb_0-7" - MB0-7 interrupts;
                   "mb_8-127" - MB8-127 interrupts;
                   "state-berr" - ERRINT | BOFFINT | BOFFDONEINT | TWRNINT |
                                  RWRNINT;
                   "mb" - all MB interrupts;
                   "all" - all interrupts combined.

- s32v234-ocotp: On S32V234 SoCs, phandle pointer to the On-Chip One Time
                 Programmable (OCOTP) node, if CAN FD support is desired on
                 compatible parts

Examples:

	can@1c000 {
		compatible = "fsl,p1010-flexcan";
		reg = <0x1c000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <48 0x2>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mpic>;
		clock-frequency = <200000000>; // filled in by bootloader
	};

	flexcan@40055000 {
		compatible = "fsl,s32v234-flexcan";
		reg = <0x0 0x40055000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 41 4>,
			     <0 42 4>;
		interrupt-names = "state-berr", "mb";
		clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_CAN0>,
			 <&clks S32V234_CLK_CAN>;
		clock-names = "ipg", "per";
		s32v234-ocotp = <&ocotp>;
	};
