QTI Snapdragon Display Engine (SDE) shared plane

This driver allows to create multiple virtual planes from the same
physical plane. Only one plane can be activated at a time.

Required properties:
- compatible:		"qcom,sde-shared-plane"
- qcom,add-planes:	Shared planes to add to the DRM system. Each child
			represents a new plane, which has the properties of:
	qcom,plane-parent: required string, name of parent plane
			where this plane is created from.
	qcom,plane-name: optional string, name of the new plane.
	qcom,plane-seamless-mode: optional string, seamless mode when plane being
			displayed can be handed off to another plane or not.
			The candidate modes are:
			"restrict": default mode, handoff can only happen
				between connectors that are sharing the same ROI
				of the same physical display.
			"shared": handoff can only happen between connectors that
				are sharing the same physical displays. ROI will
				not be checked in this mode.
			"none": handoff can only happen when plane is detached
				from display. No seamless handoff is allowed.
	qcom,plane-init-handoff: optional boolean, if set, the plane is inited
			to handoff state at system bootup. For planes with the
			same parent, only one can set to init-handoff or
			init-active state.
	qcom,plane-init-active: optional boolean, if set, the plane is inited to
			active state at system bootup. For planes with the same
			parent, only one can set to init-handoff or init-active
			state.
	qcom,plane-detach-handoff: optional boolean, if set, the plane is set to
			handoff state whenever it is detached.


Example:

/ {
	...

	qcom,sde-shared-plane {
		compatible = "qcom,sde-shared-plane";
		qcom,add-planes {
			plane@0 {
				qcom,plane-name = "plane-0-splash";
				qcom,plane-parent = "plane-0";
				qcom,plane-init-handoff;
				qcom,plane-seamless-mode = "shared";
			};
			plane@1 {
				qcom,plane-name = "plane-1-splash";
				qcom,plane-parent = "plane-1";
				qcom,plane-init-handoff;
				qcom,plane-seamless-mode = "shared";
			};
		};
	};
};
