Device Tree Bindings for the Qualcomm SD Card Controller

  The bindings follow the mmc[1], clock[2] and interrupt[3] bindings. Only
  deviations are documented here.

  [2] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
  [3] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Required Properties:
  - compatible: Compatibility string. Must be "qcom,sdcc"
	or "qcom,<SOC>-sdcc" like "qcom,apq8064-sdcc".
  - reg: From mmc bindings: Register location and length.
  - clocks: From clock bindings: Handles to clock inputs.
  - clock-names: From clock bindings: Tuple including "sdc_clk" and "sdc_pclk"
  - interrupts: Interrupt specifier
  - interrupt-names: Should be "cmd_irq" for command IRQ and
	"status_irq" for card status IRQ.

Example:

	sdcc1: sdcc@12400000 {
		compatible	= "qcom,sdcc", "qcom,apq8064-sdcc";
		status		= "disabled";
		reg		= <0x12400000 0x8000>;
		reg-names	= "core_mem";
		interrupts	= <GIC_SPI 104 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names	= "cmd_irq";
		clocks		= <&gcc SDC1_CLK>, <&gcc SDC1_H_CLK>;
		clock-names	= "sdc_clk", "sdc_pclk";
		bus-width	= <8>;
		max-frequency	= <960/00000>;
		non-removable;
		cap-sd-highspeed;
		cap-mmc-highspeed;
	};
